1. React CRUD with useState → so you can build \& display your pitch rows.
   
2. React fetch POST → fake send rows to a test API (e.g. https://httpbin.org
   ).
   
3. FastAPI basics → build your own /pitches endpoint.
   
4. Postgres basics → create tables \& insert manually.
   
5. FastAPI + Postgres → wire backend to DB.
   
6. React + FastAPI integration → send real data from your UI to Postgres
